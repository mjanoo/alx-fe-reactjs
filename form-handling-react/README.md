# Form Handling in React

This project demonstrates how to manage form data in React using **controlled components** and then transition to using **Formik** for more advanced form handling and validation.

## 🚀 Features
- User Registration Form built with controlled components.
- Validation using React’s `useState`.
- Refactored version using **Formik** + **Yup**.
- Mock API integration using [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).

## 🧩 Steps Implemented
1. Set up React app with Vite.
2. Created `RegistrationForm` using controlled components.
